About
-----

Bikini is a self-contained, minimalist, file based wiki which runs as CGI script. 

Bikini supports several typical wiki features like: 

* multiple page revisions; 
* recent changes listing (including an Atom feed version);
* needed pages;
* unlinked pages. 

Bikini uses Creole syntax to edit contents and includes a SmartyPants processor to beautify content typography.


Requirements
------------

Bikini requires Python 2.5+ and runs on Apache 2.


Setup
-----

1) Copy all the files (including the hidden .htaccess file) in the root of your web site or in a sub-folder (e.g. "notes"). The folder must be script-writable;
2) make sure the file index.cgi is executable. If not, issue a "chmod 755 index.cgi";
3) point your browser to the correct URI (e.g. http://yourserver.tld/notes/). 

If everything has been set up correctly you should see the FrontPage.

Customize your Bikini installation by copying or renaming "configuration.sample.py" file into "configuration.py" and change the settings as you wish. Please refer to http://lab.passiomatic.com/bikini/Setup for updated setup and troubleshooting information.
