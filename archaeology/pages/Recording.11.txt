==The basics==
* Photograph your history

* [[RecordLocation|Record your location]]
* [[RecordAudio|Start audio-recording your conversations]]
* [[http://jsomers.net/blog/jimbopad |JimboPad]] - record your writing process

==You are already recording==
In some ways, you may already be recording your history.

* Email accounts contain a timeline of your conversations and relationships with friends, acquaintances, family, and the outside world.
* Photo albums can contain timestamps, geolocations, and of course, other human beings. This forms a deep history of your activities, travels, and friendships.

==Three Pillars==
For many people, a record of locations, an extensive photo collection (taken with a phone or modern camera), and an email archive, form a deep history of their lives. 

These can be considered the three pillars of life-recording.

Unfortunately, not many people think much about preserving these resources. For these things, you need to focus on [[Preservation]], and on [[Reconstruction]] of the missing pieces.
