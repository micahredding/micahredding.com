Recording the audio of your life should be pretty simple. Needed:

* A digital audio recorder, which records to mp3. 
* Ideally, it should store separate files, time and date stamped.
* It should allow these to be easily copied over USB.
* It should have at least 8 hours of battery time.
* It should have at least 8 hours of onboard storage space.
* For bonus points, it should be able to record on voice activation.

MP3s should take up about 1MB per minute. This comes out to about 1.4GB per day, or 525GB per year. So a one terabyte hard drive will more than cover it, and an additional hard drive could serve as backup.

* $200 for hard drives
* $200 for the recorder (?)

== $400 to record your entire life for a year.
