This is a collection of basic principles that all social networks, cloud services, and software creators should honor.

* Customer lock-in through holding data hostage is //not// an acceptable business model.
* Don't delete user data without permission.
* Don't destroy metadata.
* Offer clear options for export or migration.
* These exports should contain //all// content and metadata.
* If you are closing shop, give at least 90 days notice, and provide clear ways to export all user-generated content.

These are becoming the standards by which we determine whether we will use your service at all.
