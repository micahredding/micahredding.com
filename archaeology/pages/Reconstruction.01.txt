Reconstruction or retrieval of our history may take many forms:

- Writing down memories.
- Extracting the historical data from a digital photo collection.
- Recovering and consolidating documents from obsolete or unique file formats.
- Scanning someone's computer for usage history.
- Collecting information from social networks.
- Scanning and parsing old papers.
- Reconstructing history by identifying physical objects.
- Best-guess algorithms, based on known large-scale events. (IE, you might have watched the news on 2001-09-11)
