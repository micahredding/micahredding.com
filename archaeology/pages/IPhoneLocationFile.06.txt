==Use an application==

This allows you to sorta see the information, but not do much with it. To use it in other ways, or to archive it yourself, go to the next section.

==Use a script==
# First, read the directions

# If you're running iOS 4, the script they reference is - http://pastebin.com/hFAt0WQH
# If you're running iOS 5, you'll need this - http://stackoverflow.com/a/8101937

All this does is give you the SQLite database of locations and other info. You'll need to find a way to read this or parse this yourself. 

==SQLite viewer==

You can look over the data, and then export it as a CSV file.

==GPS Visualizer==

You should be able to import a CSV file, and display the data on a map. I had some trouble with error pages.
