<h2>What?</h2>
<p>Personal Archaeology is the <a href="Recording">Recording</a>, <a href="Reconstruction">Reconstruction</a>, <a href="Preservation">Preservation</a>, and utilization of personal history.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Our personal history is incredibly valuable, in many ways we don't yet realize. </p>

<p>Often, our past is the most surprising and unique resource we have. We can learn from it, be inspired by it, and orient ourselves with it. Our past shows us where we are going, and the obstacles we may be likely to face again.</p>

<p>It has personal value, value for our friends and family, and value for society and history as a whole.</p>

<p>Personal Archaeology is inherently a social process - most of us would be unable to reconstruct a very complete timeline of our lives without the help of friends and family. Because of this, it is important not just to engage in our own personal archaeology, but to encourage others to engage in it as well.</p>

<h2>How?</h2>

- Recover older information stores, bringing them into alignment with our new standards.<br />
