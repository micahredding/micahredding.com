<h2>The basics</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Photograph your history</li>
	<li>Keep an email archive</li>
	<li><a href="RecordLocation">Record your location</a></li>
	<li><a href="RecordAudio">Start audio-recording your conversations</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/jimbopad">JimboPad</a> - record your writing process</li>
</ul>
<h2>You are already recording</h2>
<p>In some ways, you may already be recording your history.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Email accounts contain a timeline of your conversations and relationships with friends, acquaintances, family, and the outside world.</li>
	<li>Photo albums can contain timestamps, geolocations, and of course, other human beings. This forms a deep history of your activities, travels, and friendships.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Three Pillars</h2>
<p>For many people, a record of locations, an extensive photo collection (taken with a phone or modern camera), and an email archive, form a deep history of their lives. </p>

<p>These can be considered the three pillars of life-recording.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not many people think much about preserving these resources. For these things, you need to focus on <a href="Preservation">Preservation</a>, and on <a href="Reconstruction">Reconstruction</a> of the missing pieces.</p>
