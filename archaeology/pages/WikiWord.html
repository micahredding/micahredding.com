<p>From the <a href="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/WikiWord">TWiki documentation</a>:</p>

<p>"A WikiWord consists of two or more words with initial capitals, run together. WikiWords are topic names. A TWiki topic name always has a fixed format: two or more words with initial capitals, run together."</p>

<p>WikiWords are allowed in Bikini, although — unlike TWiki and other wiki software — it doesn't automatically link them and allows a more relaxed syntax. </p>

<p>Just remember that a WikiWord in Bikini <i>must</i> start with capital latin letter (A–Z). After the first capital letter you can freely mix letters and digits. For example, the following are all valid wiki words in Bikini: <i>Hello</i>, <i>SamplePage</i>, <i>AAA</i>, <i>SummerOf2011</i>.</p>

<p>To link a WikiWord use the usual <a href="CreoleSyntax">CreoleSyntax</a> by putting it between two square brackets.</p>
