[[https://github.com/apenwarr/bup/ | Bup]] is an innovative new project inspired by Git. It attempts to create a backup system which is capable of handling very large file systems, storing things in a very compressed format, and maintaining data integrity on the level of the actual content, rather than the file name.

It strikes me as a possible candidate for the near-ideal archival file system. 

However, one of its worst current limitations is that it does not preserve meta-data. This is being actively worked on.

Things which I'm not sure about, but which could seal the deal:

* If it can accept file backups from multiple volumes into one packfile, de-duplicate those volumes, and yet preserve them all as extractable file systems.
* If it can preserve alternate versions of the meta-data, so that the history of the meta-data is itself preserved, and so that duplicate files from different volumes can maintain their own individual meta-data sets.
* If the packfile can itself be replicated across multiple drives.
