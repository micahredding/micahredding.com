From the [[http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/WikiWord|TWiki documentation]]:

"A WikiWord consists of two or more words with initial capitals, run together. WikiWords are topic names. A TWiki topic name always has a fixed format: two or more words with initial capitals, run together."

WikiWords are allowed in Bikini, although — unlike TWiki and other wiki software — it doesn't automatically link them and allows a more relaxed syntax. 

Just remember that a WikiWord in Bikini //must// start with capital latin letter (A–Z). After the first capital letter you can freely mix letters and digits. For example, the following are all valid wiki words in Bikini: //Hello//, //SamplePage//, //AAA//, //SummerOf2011//.

To link a WikiWord use the usual [[CreoleSyntax]] by putting it between two square brackets.
