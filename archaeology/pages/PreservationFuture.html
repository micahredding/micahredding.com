<h3>Versioning</h3>
<p>Files we work on should be versioned, so we have the record of changes we made, as well as anything that may have been accidentally removed. Some operating systems, such as Mac OS X, have this built in; however, it is unclear how future-proof this proprietary system is.</p>

<h3>Separate Human Files from Computer files</h3>
<p>Some files on a computer are generated by human action (written documents, photographs, browser history), and some exist just to enable applications and software to function. Ideally, these two should be kept completely separate, so that they are not confused by human operators, so that backup and archiving can be cleanly separated from system maintenance, and so that software upgrades or removal can be done without damaging any user data.</p>

<h3>Fully Reversible Conversion</h3>
<p>Preserving our data sometimes means moving it from one format to another. The only way to insure that this preserves <strong>all</strong> of our information is to be able to reverse and test our conversions. For example, if we wanted to convert from JPEG to PDF, we should then be able to convert our resulting PDF back to JPEG, and end up with a file absolutely identical to the one we started with.</p>

<p>These files should match on a byte level, including all metadata exactly as it was.</p>

<p>This means the converted file must have all the information of the original file, and that there is a process for retrieving the original file from the converted one. </p>

<p>The converted file could contain extra information, such as the record of its conversion history, so that an entire chain of conversions could be reversed. </p>
