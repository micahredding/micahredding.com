==What?==
Personal Archaeology is the retrieval, storage, preservation, and utilization of personal history.

- Retrieval may take the form of writing down memories, discovering unknown or forgotten sources, or recovering obsolete data stores.  

- Storage is concerned with backup, and ensuring data integrity.  

- Preservation is about future-oriented data formats and storage standards.

==Why?==
Our personal history is incredibly valuable, in many ways we don't yet realize. It has personal value, value for our friends and family, and value for society and history as a whole.
