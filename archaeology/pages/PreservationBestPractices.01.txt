=== Use Open formats ===
When possible, always use older, more open formats. For example, plain text files instead of Word documents, and CSV instead of Excel files. Favored formats:
* .txt (plain text)
* .rtf (rich text)
* .csv (similar to a spreadsheet table, but stored in plain text)
* .pdf (used for documents with complex layouts)

=== Separate Working Files and Archived Files ===
File system archives should be clearly distinguished from working and operating files. Files intended to be archived should be locked and prevented from modification. 

=== Create a simple file organization system ===
When we store massive quantities of data, it becomes impossible to catalog it all by hand. Instead, organize around time and media format, instead of hierarchical groupings. A relatively flat filing structure allows for similar things to be grouped together (like photos), around a time-based ordering, giving everything a clear place and context.
