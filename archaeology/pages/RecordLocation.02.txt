There are a lot of tools for recording your travels and location history, but the portability of this data is an open question. Right now, one of the best and most open (and simple) tools seems to be Open Paths.

[[https://openpaths.cc/ | Open Paths]] - a great location tool which allows you to export and control all your data

The main benefit of Open Paths is that it records your location from your phone, and then allows you to do what you want with it, including downloading it at any time in a CSV.
