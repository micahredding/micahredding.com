==Threats==
There are several significant issues and concerns in attempting to preserve data permanently.

==What You Should Do==
Here are the approaches that have proven helpful over time.

[[PreservationBestPractices]]

==Backup==
A decent backup strategy is the first and most well-known approach to preserving information.

- The ideal backup is versioned, capturing a history of changes to the file system itself.
- The ideal backup is both local and off-site.

An easy way to accomplish these on a Mac is to combine Time Machine and Arq.
Command lines tools for this include Bup.

==Migration==
Over long periods of time, preserving data means migrating it. Whether it is locked in a social network, or stored in an old file format, migration must be done.

Migrating from cloud services is a big area of concern right now. Several [[Tools]] have been created to do this, and Google has opened an entire project called the [[http://www.dataliberation.org/ | Data Liberation Front]].

==Technological Improvement==
These are the technologies we //need// - but don't necessarily have.
