<p>This is a collection of basic principles that all social networks, cloud services, and software creators should honor.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Customer lock-in through holding data hostage is <i>not</i> an acceptable business model.</li>
	<li>Don't delete user data without permission.</li>
	<li>Don't destroy metadata.</li>
	<li>Offer clear options for export or migration.</li>
	<li>These exports should contain <i>all</i> content and metadata.</li>
	<li>If you are closing shop, give at least 90 days notice, and provide clear ways to export all user-generated content.</li>
</ul>
<p>These should be the standards by which we determine whether we will use your service at all. </p>
