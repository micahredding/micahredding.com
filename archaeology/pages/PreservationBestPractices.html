<h3>Use Open formats</h3>
<p>When possible, always use older, more open formats. For example, plain text files instead of Word documents, and CSV instead of Excel files. Favored formats:</p>
<ul>
	<li>.txt (plain text)</li>
	<li>.rtf (rich text)</li>
	<li>.csv (similar to a spreadsheet table, but stored in plain text)</li>
	<li>.pdf (used for documents with complex layouts)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Separate Working Files and Archived Files</h3>
<p>File system archives should be clearly distinguished from working and operating files. Files intended to be archived should be locked and prevented from modification. </p>

<h3>Create a simple file organization system</h3>
<p>When we store massive quantities of data, it becomes impossible to catalog it all by hand. Instead, organize around time and media format, instead of hierarchical groupings. A relatively flat filing structure allows for similar things to be grouped together (like photos), around a time-based ordering, giving everything a clear place and context. </p>
