<h2>Principles of data preservation and maintenance</h2>

<h3>Open formats</h3>
<p>The use of things like plain text files instead of Word documents, and CSV instead of Excel files. Favored formats:</p>
<ul>
	<li>.txt (plain text)</li>
	<li>.rtf (rich text)</li>
	<li>.csv (similar to a spreadsheet table, but stored in plain text)</li>
	<li>.pdf (used for documents with complex layouts)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Simple file organization</h3>
<p>Based around time and media format, instead of hierarchical groupings. One reason for this is because when we store massive quantities of data, it becomes impossible to catalog it all by hand. A relatively flat filing structure allows for similar things to be grouped together (like photos), around a time-based ordering, giving everything a clear place and context. </p>

<h3>Versioning</h3>
<p>Files we work on should be versioned, so we have the record of changes we made, as well as anything that may have been accidentally removed. Some operating systems, such as Mac OS X, have this built in; however, it is unclear how future-proof this proprietary system is.</p>

<h3>Archiving</h3>
<p>File system archives should be clearly distinguished from working and operating files. Files intended to be archived should be locked and prevented from modification. </p>

<h3>Human vs Operating System files</h3>
<p>Some files on a computer are generated by human action (written documents, photographs, browser history), and some exist just to enable applications and software to function. Ideally, these two should be kept completely separate, so that they are not confused by human operators, so that backup and archiving can be cleanly separated from system maintenance, and so that software upgrades or removal can be done without damaging any user data.</p>
