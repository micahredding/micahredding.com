==Use an application==

This allows you to sorta see the information, but not do much with it. To use it in other ways, or to archive it yourself, go to the next section.

==Do it manually==

# If you're running iOS 4, the script they reference is - http://pastebin.com/hFAt0WQH
# If you're running iOS 5, you'll need this instead - http://stackoverflow.com/a/8101937

All this does is give you the SQLite database of locations and other info. You'll need to find a way to read this or parse this yourself. 

===Work with Raw Data===

You can use this to look over the data, and then export it as a CSV file.

This script appears to only work for iOS4. I've made some updates to it, but haven't yet made this available.

Only works for iOS4

===Notes on the data structure===
The timestamps in the database file are the number of seconds since 2001-01-01.
Add 978307200 to get it in seconds since Unix 1970 epoch.
