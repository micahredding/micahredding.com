<p>Recording the audio of your life should be pretty simple. Needed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A digital audio recorder, which records to mp3.</li>
	<li>Ideally, it should store separate files, time and date stamped.</li>
	<li>It should allow these to be easily copied over USB.</li>
	<li>It should have at least 8 hours of battery time.</li>
	<li>It should have at least 8 hours of onboard storage space.</li>
	<li>For bonus points, it should be able to record on voice activation.</li>
</ul>
<p>MP3s should take up about 1MB per minute. This comes out to about 1.4GB per day, or 525GB per year. So a one terabyte hard drive will more than cover it, and an additional hard drive could serve as backup.</p>

<ul>
	<li>$200 for hard drives</li>
	<li>$200 for the recorder (?)</li>
</ul>
