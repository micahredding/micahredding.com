==Threats==
There are several significant issues and concerns in attempting to preserve data permanently.

===Fast threats===
- The short life of media, including hard disks, flash memory, and tape storage.
- Disasters that could destroy all of your media at once.
- Bad or risky backup systems. Some backup systems discard information, but never disclose this to the user.
- The (non) truth-worthiness of digital storage providers. Closures of Geocities, Friendster, etc, etc, all indicate how easy it is for a large company to destroy massive amounts of user data, without providing any recourse.

===Slow threats===
- File format obsolescence. Huge numbers of historical file formats are all-but-impossible to read or convert anymore.
- File system corruption. Files might become corrupted or lost without any notice, meaning the loss might go undetected for years.
- File system irresponsibility. Often our only context for older recovered documents are their timestamps (created on, modified on). File systems often discard this information in transfers and copying, destroying crucial historical information.

==Current best practices==
Here are the approaches that have proven helpful over time.

=== Use Open formats ===
When possible, always use older, more open formats. For example, plain text files instead of Word documents, and CSV instead of Excel files. Favored formats:
* .txt (plain text)
* .rtf (rich text)
* .csv (similar to a spreadsheet table, but stored in plain text)
* .pdf (used for documents with complex layouts)

=== Separate Working Files and Archived Files ===
File system archives should be clearly distinguished from working and operating files. Files intended to be archived should be locked and prevented from modification. 

=== Create a simple file organization system ===
When we store massive quantities of data, it becomes impossible to catalog it all by hand. Instead, organize around time and media format, instead of hierarchical groupings. A relatively flat filing structure allows for similar things to be grouped together (like photos), around a time-based ordering, giving everything a clear place and context. 

 

==Areas for Improvement==
These are the technologies we //need// - but don't necessarily have.

=== Versioning ===
Files we work on should be versioned, so we have the record of changes we made, as well as anything that may have been accidentally removed. Some operating systems, such as Mac OS X, have this built in; however, it is unclear how future-proof this proprietary system is.


=== Human vs Operating System files ===
Some files on a computer are generated by human action (written documents, photographs, browser history), and some exist just to enable applications and software to function. Ideally, these two should be kept completely separate, so that they are not confused by human operators, so that backup and archiving can be cleanly separated from system maintenance, and so that software upgrades or removal can be done without damaging any user data.
