<p>Blah.</p>

<p>Bikini uses Creole syntax to edit page contents. Here you will find several syntax elements, more are available on the official <a href="http://www.wikicreole.org/wiki/Creole1.0">Creole documentation</a>. </p>

<p><a href="./CreoleSyntax/source">View source of this page</a> to see how this page was written.</p>

<h2>== Simple text formatting</h2>
<p>Create a paragraph by ending it with one or more blank lines. Also it's easy to write //<i>Italic text</i>// and **<strong>bold text</strong>**. A line break ↵<br />
is forced with two consecutive back-slashes \\. </p>

<h2>== Links</h2>
<p>Internal links are just put between double square brackets [[ like this is link to the [[<a href="FrontPage">FrontPage</a>]]. </p>

<p>You can associate a clickable text to a link by writing its address and the text between double square brackets [[, separated by a pipe character |:</p>
<pre>
[[http://example.org/|link to example.org]]
</pre>

<p>A free standing web address will be automatically linked, e.g.: <a href="http://example.org/">http://example.org/</a>.</p>

<h2>== Headings</h2>
<p>One equal sign = as title prefix make a first level heading, which is typically reserved for page title. Also, two == and three === consecutive equal signs make a second and third level heading respectively. Actually in Bikini up to <i>three levels</i> of heading are styled. </p>

<h2>== Lists</h2>
<p>An <i>unordered</i> list is made of a series of text items each prefixed by an asterisk *:</p>
<ul>
	<li>* So, this is the first item;</li>
	<li>* and this is the second one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use a hash mark # instead of an asterisk to make <i>ordered</i> lists. Notice that nested lists are also possible:</p>
<ol>
	<li># So, this is the first item;
	<ol>
		<li>## first item in nested list;
		<ol>
			<li>### first item in second nested list;</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
	<li># and this is the second one.</li>
</ol>
<p>Four hyphens will make a horizontal rule, which will be placed after this line of text.</p>

<hr />

<h2>== Images</h2>
<p>An image address between double braces {{ defines an image.  An optional <i>alt</i> text can be added by separating the address with a pipe character |:  </p>
<pre>
{{./i/sample.jpg|Beach at Barbados, July 2004}} 
</pre>

<p><img src="./i/sample.jpg" title="each at Barbados, July 2004" alt="each at Barbados, July 2004" /> <br />

<p>Note: the <i>alt</i> text will appear if specified image could not be loaded.</p>

<h2>== Preformatted sections</h2>
<p>Three braces {{{ blocks allow to specify preformatted sections. Bikini will style those with a <tt>monospaced</tt> font and whitespace characters will be preserved. No further Creole syntax processing is performed on enclosed text.</p>
<pre>
This preformatted text 
will appear **as-is**.
</pre>

<h2>== What about the plain ol' HTML code?</h2>
<p>All HTML code is escaped thus it will appear as such on the page, like this &lt;table&gt; element.</p>

<h2>== Limitations</h2>
<p>Please keep in mind that Bikini currently has full support for Creole 1.0 syntax except <a href="http://www.wikicreole.org/wiki/CreoleAdditions">optional additions</a> like inlines styles for superscript, subscript, etc.</p>
