  <h2>Seattle</h2> 
  I lived in the Seattle area when I was 3, 4, 5, and 6. Then again when I was 10. Then again when I was 19. We used to walk around downtown, then take the ferries over to small islands, wander around there until we stumbled on some independent film-makers showing off their first movie, then return home at the end of the day, tired and laden with thrift-store discoveries.

  <h2>Oklahoma</h2> 
  I lived in Oklahoma when I was in my late teens. We were in a small town in the middle of nowhere, but with a wide-open horizon, sunlight, and the possibility of diving into the lake in the middle of the night, or climbing on top of our large, rambling old house, or sneaking into an abandoned antique-looking building in the center of town.

  <h2>Kathmandu</h2> 
  In 2012, my brother and I were traveling around the world, and ended up staying with a family in Kathmandu, Nepal. They had iffy running water, and nothing like what we think of as a "bathroom", but their accomodations were luxurious. We slept on a hard slab of a bed in a hut on top of their house, with the windows open and the electricity unpredictably turning on and off across the city. After a few days, we hiked past farmers and cottages into the mountains and spent the night, looking for the sunrise.
